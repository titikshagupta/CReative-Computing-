<h1>WHAT IS STOCK MARKET?</h1>
A stock market or a share market, is a congregation of buyers and sellers of stocks /shares, which represent ownership claims on businesses. Stocks can be listed on a public stock exchange or privately traded, such as shares of private companies sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Stockbrokers and computerised trading platforms are the most common ways to invest in the stock market.

<h2>ALGORITHMIC TRADING</h2>
Algorithmic trading makes decisions to buy or sell financial securities on an exchange using <em>complicated calculations, mathematical models, and human oversight</em>. High-frequency trading technology, which allows a company to make tens of thousands of deals per second, is frequently used by algorithmic traders. Order execution, arbitrage, and trend trading methods are all examples of scenarios where algorithmic trading can be applied.

After computerised trading systems were introduced in American financial markets in the 1970s, the use of algorithms in trading increased. In the decades that followed, exchanges improved their ability to handle electronic trading, and by 2009, computers had conducted about 60% of all trades in the United States.


<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Algorithmic Trading</h3?
  <ol>
  <li>Algorithmic trading is mainly used by institutional investors and big brokerage houses to cut down on costs associated with trading.</li>
  <li>Algorithmic trading also allows for faster and easier execution of orders, making it attractive for exchanges. In turn, this means that traders and investors can quickly book profits off small changes in price</li>
  <li>When numerous orders are performed concurrently without human interaction, the speed of order execution, which is advantageous in most cases, might become a problem.</li>
  <li>Another downside of algorithmic trading is that liquidity, which is generated by rapid buy and sell orders, can vanish in an instant, removing the opportunity for traders to profit from price fluctuations. It can also result in an immediate loss of liquidity.</li>

  <h2>Algorithmic Trading Strategies</h2>
  The strategy should be market prudent, in the sense that it is fundamentally sound from a market and economic perspective. Furthermore, the mathematical model utilised to construct the approach should be founded on strong statistical principles. 

Next, figure out what data your robot is attempting to collect. Your robot must be able to collect identified, persistent market inefficiencies in order to have an automated approach. The occurrence of one-time market inefficiency is not enough to build a strategy around. Algorithmic trading techniques follow a tight set of rules that take advantage of market behaviour. Furthermore, if the cause of market inefficiency is unknown, there will be no means of knowing whether the strategy's success or failure was due to chance or not.

 <h2>Backtesting and Optimization </h2>
 Backtesting focuses on validating your trading robot, which includes checking the code to ensure it is doing what you want and understanding how the strategy performs across various time frames, asset classes, and market conditions, as you'll want to maximise performance while minimising overfitting bias. You must first choose a good performance measure that captures risk and reward factors, as well as consistency, in order to maximise performance.
 
<h2>Live Execution</h2>
Apart from being prepared for the emotional ups and downs that you may encounter, there are a few technological issues to be handled. Selecting an acceptable broker and adopting procedures to handle both market and operational risks, such as potential hackers and technology outages, while ensuring the robot is as efficient as it was during the testing period, are among these concerns.
 
 The most important part of algorithmic trading is <strong>“understanding under which types of market conditions your robot will work and when it will break down”</strong> and <strong>“understanding when to intervene.”</strong> Algorithmic trading can be rewarding, but the key to success is understanding. Any course or teacher promising high rewards without sufficient understanding should be a major warning sign to stay away.
