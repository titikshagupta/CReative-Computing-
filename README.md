<h1>WHAT IS STOCK MARKET?</h1>
A stock market or a share market, is a congregation of buyers and sellers of stocks /shares, which represent ownership claims on businesses. Stocks can be listed on a public stock exchange or privately traded, such as shares of private companies sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Stockbrokers and computerised trading platforms are the most common ways to invest in the stock market.

<h2>ALGORITHMIC TRADING</h2>
Algorithmic trading makes decisions to buy or sell financial securities on an exchange using <em>complicated calculations, mathematical models, and human oversight</em>. High-frequency trading technology, which allows a company to make tens of thousands of deals per second, is frequently used by algorithmic traders. Order execution, arbitrage, and trend trading methods are all examples of scenarios where algorithmic trading can be applied.
