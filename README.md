<h1>WHAT IS STOCK MARKET?1</h1>
A stock market or a share market, is a congregation of buyers and sellers of stocks /shares, which represent ownership claims on businesses. Stocks can be listed on a public stock exchange or privately traded, such as shares of private companies sold to investors through equity crowdfunding platforms. Stockbrokers and computerised trading platforms are the most common ways to invest in the stock market.
